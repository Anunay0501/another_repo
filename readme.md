This repository is being made locally. Later on, I'll push this to my github account to see if it works and learn the process.

Difficulty that I face is that the tutorial is in MacOs and that there are changes in some command lines and output that I see in tutorial and on my machine. Not a dealbreaker but enough to waste time.

The tutor also doesn't save the file before adding. I don't why but I have to save the file and then only I could perform add. Saving makes more sense. My intuition, saving happens in the file outside repository in local and adding happens in repository in machine i.e. in .git hidden folder.


Some things that I should learn:-
    1) difference between powershell and cmd.
    2) Markdown syntaxes.
